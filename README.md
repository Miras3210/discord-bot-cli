# discord-bot-cli
Discord bot cli for simple and easy control of the bot with some simple features.

Hello, this is one of my small but really cool projects.
The way it works is you log in to discord API using your bot token key.
Then you have a selection windows and you navigate through servers and channels.

# Program controls
- escape (go back)
- arrow keys (up down)
- enter (select)

also be carefull when typing, it sometimes freezes a little.

I'll be updating this and if you have any issues or problems, please report them.
